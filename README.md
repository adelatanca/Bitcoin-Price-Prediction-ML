# Bitcoin-Price-Prediction-ML

## Project description 

This project explores LSTM algorithms versus traditional methods like Random Forest in predicting Bitcoin prices, aiming to identify the most accurate approach amid cryptocurrency market volatility. It analyzes how different datasets and features impact model performance through extensive data collection and processing of historical Bitcoin prices and trading volumes.

Additionally, the study integrates sentiment analysis of Reddit posts to gauge public sentiment's correlation with Bitcoin price fluctuations. Using advanced NLP and machine learning, sentiment from relevant posts is classified into positive, neutral, and negative tones, comparing these findings with historical price data to assess sentiment's impact.

This research enhances understanding of Bitcoin price drivers and informs more informed trading strategies. It contributes to financial machine learning literature, highlighting the potential and limitations of these technologies in cryptocurrency analysis, benefiting both investors and future researchers.
